# FigureForge — working context

Publication-ready multi-panel figure assembly for life-science journals: the
layout control of Illustrator, the plotting of Prism, and reproducibility that
neither offers.

Requirements source of truth: [`build-a-nature-style-platform.md`](build-a-nature-style-platform.md).
That spec describes a multi-year product surface (30+ chart types, omics compute,
Electron, an AI layout assistant). It was deliberately cut to one complete
vertical slice — data in, publication-ready vector out — so the architecture
could be proven before breadth was added. **Phases 1–2 are done; phases 3–9 are not.**

---

## Running it

Everything runs in containers. **The host has no Node and no Python scientific
stack** — never run `npm` or `pytest` on the host, run them inside the containers
(the Makefile targets already do).

```bash
make up          # build images, start the pod
                 #   web -> http://localhost:5173
                 #   api -> http://localhost:8000/health
make test        # 110 TypeScript + 38 Python tests
make acceptance  # 28-check end-to-end run (needs `make up` first)
make down
```

`make help` lists all 15 targets.

The dev environment is a rootless podman **pod**, so both containers share one
network namespace and the web app reaches the API on plain `localhost:8000`.
`compose.yaml` exists for anyone on Docker proper (there, the API is a separate
host, hence `VITE_API_URL`).

---

## Architecture, and why

The reasoning matters more than the structure — it is what stops a later session
undoing a deliberate choice.

### The one commitment

The spec asked for both a Matplotlib backend *and* SVG-native rendering. These
are incompatible: Matplotlib emits `<path>` soup inside clip groups, so you
cannot click an axis label to edit it, cannot enforce typography across panels,
and cannot guarantee the export matches the screen.

> **The figure is one SVG document, rendered from a typed JSON model by
> isomorphic TypeScript. Python receives numbers and returns numbers — never
> pixels.**

Export runs *the same renderer* headless, so WYSIWYG is structural rather than
maintained by hand.

### Invariants — do not break these

- **`packages/render` must never import the DOM.** This is what keeps canvas and
  export identical; a DOM import breaks export fidelity silently.
  `packages/render/src/parity.test.tsx` holds both output adapters to identical
  markup and will fail if they drift.
- **Millimetres internally**, emitted 1:1 as viewBox units
  (`width="183mm" viewBox="0 0 183 75"`). Journal widths need no conversion and
  PDFs come out at exact physical size. Type sizes are the deliberate exception —
  stored in **points**, because journals specify them that way ("panel labels
  8 pt bold"), converted at render.
- **Rendering is a pure function of the document.** Anything that varies per
  render (jitter) must be seeded — `marks.ts` uses `mulberry32` keyed off the
  node id, or the export would not match the screen.
- **`doc-model` imports nothing internal**, so anything needing measured plot
  geometry takes it as a *parameter* (`PlotMeasurements`), never by importing
  `measurePlot`. `render` depends on `doc-model`; the reverse would be a cycle.
  `measureAllPlots` in `render-document.ts` is the bridge callers use.
- **Layout decisions taken inside the renderer must be deterministic and
  DOM-free.** Tick-label collision handling measures text with the static tables
  in `text-width.ts` rather than `getComputedTextLength`, so the canvas and the
  headless exporter reach the *same* decision. Measuring in the browser would
  put angled labels on screen and overlapping ones in the PDF.

### Package split

```
packages/doc-model/   model, zod schema, undo/redo, layout, operations, .figureforge I/O
packages/theme/       journal presets, palettes, colour-vision validation
packages/plots/       scales, summary statistics, mark geometry   ← maths only
packages/render/      scene tree → {React | SVG string}, quality checker  ← drawing only
apps/web/             Vite + React canvas, inspectors, import/export UI
services/api/         FastAPI: SciPy statistics, Chromium/Ghostscript export
scripts/acceptance.ts end-to-end flow, no UI involved
```

**`plots` computes numbers and `render` draws them.** That split is why the plot
maths is testable against exact expected values, and why there is no dependency
cycle between the two. If drawing logic starts appearing in `plots`, or scale
maths in `render`, the split is being eroded.

`doc-model` depends on nothing internal. `theme` and `plots` depend on
`doc-model`. `render` depends on all three. Keep it that way.

### Model choices

- **Flat node map keyed by id, each with a `parentId`** — not a nested tree.
  Immutable updates touch one entry; reparenting and z-reordering never
  restructure anything.
- **Edits go through Immer `produceWithPatches`** (`store.ts`), so undo/redo,
  version history and incremental autosave are one mechanism, not three.
  Use `editDocument()` to mutate outside the store — it confines the readonly cast.
- **`.figureforge` is a zip**, not one big JSON: micrographs are the bulk of a real
  figure's bytes and base64-ing TIFFs into JSON is untenable. `data/` holds the
  **verbatim** original imports, byte for byte — that is what makes the
  reproducibility claim real. Each analysis stores an `inputHash` so a figure can
  never silently display a p-value its data no longer supports.

### Statistics choices

Each guards against a specific, common reporting error:

- **Significance annotations read the *adjusted* p-value.** Starring uncorrected
  p-values on a multi-comparison figure is one of the most frequent statistical
  errors in published figures.
- **Effect sizes always returned, with Hedges' correction** — at n = 3–6, plain
  Cohen's *d* noticeably overstates the effect.
- **Confidence intervals use the t distribution.** At n = 3 the correct
  multiplier is 4.303, not 1.96; the 1.96 shortcut badly understates the interval.
- **Tests are verified against externally published values** — Student's 1908
  sleep data and R's documented output for `t.test`, `aov`, `cor.test` — not
  against numbers this code produced itself.
- **One analysis per plot.** Re-running a test replaces the previous result and
  its brackets (`replaceAnalysisForPlot` + `removeBracketsForPlot`) rather than
  appending. Accumulating them stacked new brackets at the same heights as the
  old, since the placement gap restarts each run.
- **The stored input hash is composed in exactly one place**, `analysisInputHash`.
  Composing it per call site is how a stored hash and a recomputed one come to
  disagree over nothing, which surfaces as "the data changed" on an untouched
  figure — that bug was live in the acceptance script.

---

## Current state

Phases 1–2 committed as `fb401cb`: ~9,570 lines of source across 80 tracked files.

Uncommitted on top of that commit: this file, and a fix in `analysis.ts` replacing
a raw NUL byte with the escape `'\u0000'` — the same character, so every hash is
byte-identical and nothing behavioural changed (see the trap below). Run
`git status` before assuming the tree is clean.

**Verified:** 110 TypeScript tests, 38 Python tests, typecheck and lint clean,
28-check acceptance run. Exported PDF confirmed single-page, fonts embedded,
text selectable, exactly 183.0000 × 75.0000 mm; PNG exactly 300 dpi.

Working end to end: CSV/TSV import with format detection, live preview and a
user-supplied dataset name → bar/dot/beeswarm marks with error bars → Welch's
t-test and friends with corrections and effect sizes → significance bracket
placed on measured geometry, which follows the plot when it moves →
auto-layout with smart guides and snapping, weighted templates, and drag-resize
handles → panel lettering in reading order → an Inspector for the selected node
(colours, text, axis titles, frame) with double-click-to-edit on canvas →
PDF/EPS/SVG/PNG/TIFF export → Publication Readiness Score → project save/load.

### The editing iteration (after phases 1–2)

A round of reported bugs and requests, all fixed on the phase 1–2 surface:

- **Stats replace rather than accumulate.** `BracketNode.plotId` and
  `Analysis.plotId` join annotations to their plot.
- **Brackets follow their bars.** `repositionBrackets` re-measures on layout,
  resize and import. A manual drag is stored as `userOffsetMm` — an *offset*,
  not a pin, so a nudged bracket keeps its adjustment and still tracks the data.
  `measurePlot` is memoised on `(plot, dataset, theme)` identity, which Immer's
  structural sharing makes a sound key.
- **Axis labels never overprint.** Category labels tilt to 45° when they outgrow
  their band, then stand upright at 90° when 45° would force truncation —
  upright labels are bounded by the space below the axis instead of by their
  neighbours, so long names survive whole. The x title is placed below whatever
  depth the labels reach, clamped to the panel.
- **New surfaces:** Inspector tab, keyboard Delete, dataset rename that
  propagates to panels and plots, provenance in the Layers list, layout
  templates, panel resize handles.

Two traps found by driving the real browser, which neither the unit tests nor
the parity test could catch — both are now covered:

- A `style` **string** on a scene node renders fine through the string
  serialiser and *throws in React*, blanking the canvas whenever anything was
  selected. Parity compares two strings, so it saw nothing. `parity.test.tsx`
  now asserts `toReact` does not throw on chrome.
- Setting a panel's frame through the Inspector without `resizePanel` left its
  plot at the old size inside the resized panel.

## What's next

Phases 3–9, with the actual entry points:

| Phase | Scope | Where to start |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | box, violin, line, scatter, histogram | `packages/plots/src/marks.ts` (pure functions) + a branch in `computePlotGeometry`/`renderPlot` |
| 4 | image panels, crop, scale bars, annotations | node types and renderers **already exist** — needs UI and asset plumbing |
| 5 | remaining stats surface | `services/api/figureforge/stats/tests.py` |
| 6 | export/QC hardening, autofixes | `packages/render/src/quality.ts` |
| 7 | heatmaps, PCA, UMAP, volcano, survival | new mark types; needs the DOM-volume answer below first |
| 8 | Electron shell | new; see the sidecar risk below |
| 9 | AI layout assistant | `packages/doc-model/src/layout.ts` already has the geometry |

### Already scaffolded but unused

- **Node types** `image`, `scale-bar`, `arrow`, `shape`, `group` are fully
  implemented in the model, schema and renderer, but nothing in the UI creates
  them. Scale bars already derive their length from the parent image's
  calibration and on-page size, which is the hard part.
- **Statistical tests** `chi-square`, `linear-regression`, `wilcoxon` are
  implemented in the API but absent from the UI dropdown in `SidePanel.tsx`.
- **Panel `slot`** (`{row, col, rowSpan, colSpan}`) is written by layout
  templates and honoured by `autoLayout`, but nothing lets a user author a slot
  directly — templates are the only way to set one.
- **Asset pipeline**: `resolveAsset` is wired through the renderer and
  `App.tsx` passes `assetUrls={{}}`. Image panels need blob URLs in the browser
  and data URIs on export — the seam exists, nothing fills it.

### Two declared-but-missing things — check before trusting the types

- **`PlotType` declares 9 variants; only 4 render distinctly.** `bar`, `dot`,
  `bar-dot` and `beeswarm` are real. `scatter`, `line`, `box`, `violin` and
  `histogram` pass the type system and the zod schema but fall through to the
  categorical dot path and render as something plausible-looking and wrong.
  Adding one means: the mark geometry, a renderer branch, and nothing else — the
  union in `nodes.ts:84` and its mirror in `schema.ts:87` already list them.
  The Inspector's plot-type dropdown deliberately offers **only the four that
  work** (`OFFERED_PLOT_TYPES` in `Inspector.tsx`); extend that list as each
  lands, or the UI starts shipping controls that produce wrong output.
- **`anova-rm` is in the `StatTest` union and in the `parametric` set
  (`tests.py:250`) but has no dispatch branch**, so calling it raises
  `Unsupported test: anova-rm`. It is not in the UI dropdown, so it is not
  user-reachable — but the type says it works.

## Risks and open problems

| Risk | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Electron packaging** | Web-first deferred this, it did not remove it. The desktop shell needs Python bundled as a sidecar process with lifecycle management — real work, not a wrapper. |
| **Omics panel volume** | A 100k-point UMAP as SVG nodes will kill the DOM. Phase 7 needs downsampling or a canvas/WebGL inset before the marks are written, not after. |
| **Stale bracket positions** | *Fixed.* `repositionBrackets` re-measures on layout, resize and import; `userOffsetMm` preserves manual nudges. The staleness *warning* (data edited after a test) now fires in the Stats tab and the quality checker, but nothing re-runs the test automatically — by design. |
| **`measurePlot` recomputes** | *Mitigated.* Memoised on `(plot, dataset, theme)` object identity. The cache is per-call-site correct but unbounded reasoning applies: it is a `WeakMap`, so entries die with their nodes. |
| **No schema migrations** | `SCHEMA_VERSION` is still 1 and `loadArchive` rejects anything newer. Every field added in the editing iteration (`plotId`, `userOffsetMm`, `comparisonIndex`, `gapMm`, `slot`, `pointsUseSeriesColor`) is **optional**, so old files still load and this was not forced. The next *required* field forces it. **zod strips unknown keys**: a field added to a TS type but not to `schema.ts` is silently dropped on save/load. |
| **Text metrics are estimated** | `text-width.ts` uses static Helvetica/Arial advance widths. Correct for the shipped Liberation Sans, and deterministic across canvas and export, which is what matters — but a user-supplied font with different metrics would make the collision decisions slightly off. |
| **Autofixes are advertised, not implemented** | Quality checker findings carry `autoFixable: true`, but no fixer is wired up and the UI offers no button. Either build them or stop claiming it. |
| **Font licensing** | Arial is not redistributable. The image ships Liberation Sans, which is metrically identical so layout is unaffected, and the theme stack falls back to it. A user wanting genuine Arial must supply it. |

## Environment traps already hit

Each of these cost time once and will again:

- **The host shell is sandboxed from pod-published ports.** `curl localhost:8000`
  from the host returns nothing even when the service is healthy. Verify from
  *inside* the pod (`podman exec figureforge-web node -e '...'`) or with a
  container joined to the pod (`podman run --pod figureforge ...`).
- **The Bash tool's working directory persists between calls.** A stale `cd` from
  an earlier command silently made `-v "$PWD":/app` mount the wrong directory.
  Use absolute paths in mounts.
- **`python:3.12-slim` now resolves to Debian trixie**, where Playwright's
  `--with-deps` fails on font packages Debian has dropped. Pinned to
  `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`. Do not un-pin it.
- **`@eslint/js@10` requires ESLint 10**; this repo is on the v9 line. Both must
  move together.
- **SELinux needs `:z` on every bind mount** (this is Fedora), and `node_modules`
  must be a named volume, not part of the bind mount.
- **Vite needs `usePolling`** — inotify events do not cross the container boundary
  reliably.
- **Piping a build through `tail` masks its exit code.** An image build "succeeded"
  with exit 0 while actually failing. Check the output, not `$?`.
- **zod rebuilds objects in schema key order**, so `JSON.stringify` comparison of
  a round-tripped document reports a difference that does not exist. Use
  `stableStringify` from `analysis.ts`.
- **A raw NUL byte in a source file makes `grep` skip it silently.** One crept
  into `analysis.ts` (a `'\x00'` where `' '` was intended) and `file` reported the
  source as `data`; greps for symbols in it returned nothing, which reads exactly
  like "that symbol does not exist". Fixed, but if a symbol you can see with
  `sed`/`tail` won't `grep`, check `file` and scan for `\x00` before concluding
  anything.
- **React wants camelCase SVG attributes.** The scene stores canonical hyphenated
  names (what the exporter writes verbatim); `react.tsx` converts. Both adapters
  must still emit identical markup — the parity test enforces it.
- **Green tests do not mean the app runs.** The suites render through the string
  serialiser and `renderToStaticMarkup`; neither mounts the real UI. A `style`
  string on a scene node passed every one of them and threw in the browser,
  blanking the canvas on any selection. Playwright is already in the API image
  (it drives export) and can reach the web container across the shared pod
  namespace — use it to click through a change before calling it done:
  `podman cp smoke.py figureforge-api:/tmp/ && podman exec figureforge-api python /tmp/smoke.py`.
- **Playwright clicks an element's centre.** A Layers row's centre is its delete
  button, so `row.click()` deletes the node instead of selecting it. Target the
  name span. Likewise `inner_text()` fails on SVG (`text_content()` works), and
  a synthetic `input` event does not drive a React controlled input — use
  `fill()`, which goes through the native setter React tracks.

### Export traps encoded in the code

Three are handled deliberately in `services/api/figureforge/export/renderer.py`;
if you touch that file, keep them:

1. **`svg { display: block }`** — an inline SVG sits on a text baseline and the
   descender space beneath it spills past the page box, producing a second blank
   page, after which Ghostscript refuses EPS conversion entirely.
2. **Chromium rounds the page box up to a whole 1/300 inch**, so 183 mm lands on
   183.13 mm. `crop_to_exact` trims it back. **Crop, never scale** — rescaling
   would shrink every font below the minimum the theme guarantees.
3. **Fonts and the Chromium build are pinned in the image**, which is what makes
   exports reproducible across machines.

## Conventions

- Match the surrounding comment density. Comments explain **why**, not what —
  most existing comments justify a non-obvious choice, and that is the bar.
- Tests assert against **externally published reference values** wherever they
  exist. A test that only proves the code agrees with itself is not worth much.
- **Verify by running things.** Every claim in this file was checked against real
  output — test counts from a run, PDF dimensions from the MediaBox, DPI from the
  pixel count. Hold new claims to the same standard.
- Report honestly: if something is declared but not implemented, say so (see the
  two cases above) rather than letting the type signature imply otherwise.
